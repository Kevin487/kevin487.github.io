# CMPSC 480: Portfolio project reflection

A brief description of your site build process (including challenges and solutions)
A summary of the audiences for which the site is built and how its overall form and content cater to their interests
How your design decisions are informed by the various professional documents you've completed this semester

My website utilizes a hugo theme and it was a pretty straight forward. I was really lucky enough to find a very straight forward theme that allowed to me pretty much just find where I needed to plug things in. It also came with a lot of very good animations. However, the most difficult part was putting in my certificates as I needed to have the correct format and utlize proper CSS tactics I learned in web development. Other than that, there were not significant tasks I was stuck with. If anything, I was able to overcome those tasks very fast by reaching out to TA's.

This website will be used to display my professional experiences. The audience I will like to target are members within the financial services professional field, but particularly target professionals working in Investment Banking, Private Equity, Venture Capital, and Investments. The content within the website will cater to these individuals as it is not too creative, straight forward, displays a level of seriousness, and also includes project that will be interesting to those individuals. The projects I've included reflect my technical skills, business analytical skills, and quantitative skills.

Furthermore, my design decision came from various professional documents I completed this semester. First and foremost, I understand the field of investment banking is generally a serious field, so the design of my website is very straight forward and not as creative as a website tailored towards a engineering and design professional. Furthermore, I looked a professional documents, such as job postings to understand the skills required for the fields I mentioned. Therefore, I ensured to include relevant skills, job experiences, certificates, photos, and projects that will reflect proper qualifications.

<!-- It's Somrat, Professional Web Developer. I love to write code, it's my passoin.

Stay connect with me........ðŸ˜Š -->

I grew up in Queens, New York as a 2nd generation Korean American and became a 1st generation college student with a avid passion for business, as my Momâ€™s small business grew from 1 employee to 65+ employees over the course of 10+ years.

As an enthusiastic learner, I engaged with my Momâ€™s business and a liberal arts business & computer science (Cmpsci) education. I explored philosophy and communications alongside my quantitative finance, economics, business, math, and computer science classes.

I got to explore different careers, through Allegheny College, and I interned with the IRS and Barclays. Both experiences provided me with great learning opportunities and social environments, as I was tasked with a lot of financial projects and engagement with external/ internal clients.

Through Barclays I obtained mentors who revealed the various career paths within finance. I quickly got to work in the fall, as a senior, and obtained two remote internships with one being in private equity and the other with venture capital. I leveraged these internships to gain valuable valuation and financial modeling experiences while also being exposed to external client management.

In my spare time, I have an avid passion for volunteering and have traveled to multiple underserved rural cities within countries such as Nicaragua, Panama, Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Paraguay, and etc. to do community service. I also love the outdoors, poker, and spending time with friends/ family.
